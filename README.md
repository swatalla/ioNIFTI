# ioNIFTI
.NET IO library for NIFTI image files

This library has both C# and F# modules for reading NIFTI files, and has seen successful use in conjunction with my FFT library for slice-timing correction of fMRI data.

The C# library is present for those who prefer debugging C# over F#; however, the F# module is more complete.

DICOM capability is currently under development.
